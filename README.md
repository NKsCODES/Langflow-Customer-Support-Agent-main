# Langflow-Customer-Support-Agent

## ✅ What the Project Demonstrates
Building a Real-World AI Assistant

It shows how to create an autonomous AI agent capable of interacting with multiple tools, models, and APIs to solve complex problems.

LlamaIndex for Intelligent Information Retrieval

The agent uses LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index) to index large sets of documents or databases, allowing it to search and reference data efficiently.

Running Local LLMs with Ollama

The project integrates Ollama, which runs local open-source LLMs like LLaMA 2, Mistral, etc., enabling fully local, secure AI execution without relying on external APIs.

Multi-Modal Capabilities

The agent can potentially work with text, PDFs, web data, and more — making it “multi-modal” and adaptable for various business and research use cases.

Tool-Oriented Reasoning via LangChain Agents

It uses LangChain’s agent framework to plan tasks and make decisions — for example, knowing when to search vs. when to summarize.

End-to-End Pipeline & API Deployment

The project includes an API layer (Flask) and is packaged using Docker, ready for production deployment or integration with other services.
